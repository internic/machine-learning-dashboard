                              Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
                            </p>

                              Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, <b>it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p>Logistic Regression is much similar to the Linear Regression except that how they are used. Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems, whereas <b>Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems</b>.</p>

                            <p>In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an "S" shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).</p>

                            <p>The curve from the logistic function indicates the likelihood of something such as whether the cells are cancerous or not, a mouse is obese or not based on its weight, etc.</p>

                            <p>
                                Logistic Regression is a significant machine learning algorithm because it has the ability to provide probabilities and classify new data using continuous and discrete datasets.
                            </p>

                            <p>Logistic Regression can be used to classify the observations using different types of data and can easily determine the most effective variables used for the classification. </p>
                            
                            <p>Logistic regression uses the concept of predictive modeling as regression; therefore, it is called logistic regression, but is used to classify samples; Therefore, it falls under the classification algorithm.</p>

                                <h5>Example</h5>
                      
                              </div>

                              <p>As a simple example, we can use a logistic regression with one explanatory variable and two categories to answer the following question:</p>
      
                            <p><i>A group of 20 students spends between 0 and 6 hours studying for an exam. How does the number of hours spent studying affect the probability of the student passing the exam?</i></p>

                            <p>
                                The reason for using logistic regression for this problem is that the values of the dependent variable, pass and fail, while represented by "1" and "0", are not cardinal numbers. If the problem was changed so that pass/fail was replaced with the grade 0â€“100 (cardinal numbers), then simple regression analysis could be used.

                                The table shows the number of hours each student spent studying, and whether they passed (1) or failed (0).
