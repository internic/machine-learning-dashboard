                              Overfitting occurs when our machine learning model tries to cover all the data points or more than the required data points present in the given dataset. Because of this, the model starts caching noise and inaccurate values present in the dataset, and all these factors reduce the efficiency and accuracy of the model. The overfitted model has low bias and high variance.

                              The chances of occurrence of overfitting increase as much we provide training to our model. It means the more we train our model, the more chances of occurring the overfitted model.
                            </p>

                            <p>Overfitting is the main problem that occurs in supervised learning.</p>

                            <p>The concept of the overfitting can be understood by the below graph of the linear regression output:</p>

                            <p>As we can see from the above graph, the model tries to cover all the data points present in the scatter plot. It may look efficient, but in reality, it is not so. Because the goal of the regression model to find the best fit line, but here we have not got any best fit, so, it will generate the prediction errors.</p>

                              Underfitting occurs when our machine learning model is not able to capture the underlying trend of the data. To avoid the overfitting in the model, the fed of training data can be stopped at an early stage, due to which the model may not learn enough from the training data. As a result, it may fail to find the best fit of the dominant trend in the data.
                            </p>

                            <p>In the case of underfitting, the model is not able to learn enough from the training data, and hence it reduces the accuracy and produces unreliable predictions.</p>
      
                            <p>An underfitted model has high bias and low variance.</p>

                            <p>We can understand the underfitting using below output of the linear regression model:</p>

                            <p>As we can see from the above diagram, the model is unable to capture the data points present in the plot.</p>
